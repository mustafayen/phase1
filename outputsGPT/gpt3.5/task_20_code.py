Here is a Python function that performs matrix multiplication:

```python
def matrix_multiplication(A, B):
    result = [[0 for _ in range(len(B[0]))] for _ in range(len(A))]
    
    for i in range(len(A)):
        for j in range(len(B[0])):
            for k in range(len(B)):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    
    return result
```

You can use this function by passing two matrices `A` and `B` as arguments. The function will return the result of multiplying matrix `A` by matrix `B`.
