Here is a complete Python function that finds the closest elements in a list of numbers:

```python
def find_closest_elements(numbers):
    numbers.sort()  # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    min_diff = float('inf')  # Initialize the minimum difference to infinity
    closest_elements = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the closest elements
    
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1])  # Calculate the difference between adjacent elements
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_elements = [numbers[i], numbers[i+1]]  # Update the closest elements
    
    return closest_elements

# Test the function
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(find_closest_elements(numbers))  # Output: [3, 5]
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and then iterates through the list to find the closest pair of elements. It calculates the difference between adjacent elements and updates the closest pair if a smaller difference is found. Finally, it returns the closest pair of elements.
