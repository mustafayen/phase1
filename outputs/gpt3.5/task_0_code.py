```python
def has_close_elements(numbers, threshold):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold value as input. It then iterates through all pairs of numbers in the list and checks if the absolute difference between them is less than or equal to the threshold. If it finds a pair that meets this condition, it returns True. If no such pair is found, it returns False.
