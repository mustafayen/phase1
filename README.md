# Phase 1 - Automatic Code and Test Generation

This repository contains the results of Phase 1 of the **BLG475E Software Engineering** course project.

The project focuses on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to **automatically generate Python functions and unit tests** based on programming problems from the HumanEval dataset.

- `outputsGPT/gpt3.5/`: Solutions generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.
- `outputsGemini/gemini2.0`: Unit tests generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash.
- `humaneval_prompts_with_difficulty.csv`: Contains the HumanEval problem prompts along with their associated difficulty levels, used for selecting and organizing tasks.
- `generate_gpt35_tests.py`: Used GPT-3.5 Turbo to automatically generate Python code and corresponding unit test files based on problem descriptions.
- `run_all_tests_gemini.py`: Script to execute and evaluate all test cases.
- `run_all_tests_gpt.py`: Script to execute and evaluate all test cases.
