# Phase 1 - Automatic Code and Test Generation

This repository contains the results of Phase 1 of the **BLG475E Software Engineering** course project.

The project focuses on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to **automatically generate Python functions and unit tests** based on programming problems from the HumanEval dataset.

- `outputs/gpt3.5/`: Solutions generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.
- `tests/`: Unit tests generated by Gemini 2.0 Flash.
- `humaneval_prompts_with_difficulty.csv`: Contains the HumanEval problem prompts along with their associated difficulty levels, used for selecting and organizing tasks.
- `generate_gpt35_tests.py`: Used GPT-3.5 Turbo to automatically generate Python code and corresponding unit test files based on problem descriptions.
- `run_all_tests_gemini.py`: Script to execute and evaluate all test cases.
- `run_all_tests_gpt.py`: Script to execute and evaluate all test cases.

## Models Used

| Model              | Purpose                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| GPT-3.5-turbo       | Initial code generation     |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash    | Additional robust test generation |

---

## Results

| Category | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Total Tasks Attempted | 30 |
| Successful Tasks (Tests Passed) | 30 |
| Skipped Tasks (due to syntax errors) | 8 |
| Total Tests Run | 22 |
| Successful Tests | 22 |
| Test Success Rate | 100.00% |

> **Note:** Skipped tasks were caused by syntax issues in the original GPT-3.5 code generation, not the test generation.
